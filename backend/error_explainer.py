"""Turn raw install failures into actionable diagnoses.

The runner produces a stream of stdout/stderr lines plus a final exit code.
Given the failed step and recent log tail, this module classifies the
failure into a known category and returns:
  - title          (one-line summary)
  - why            (why it happened, plain English)
  - fix            (concrete remediation, executable where possible)
  - retryable      (bool — is it safe to retry the step after the fix?)
  - category       (port_conflict | disk_full | oom | image_pull | daemon_down |
                    perm_denied | network | unknown)
