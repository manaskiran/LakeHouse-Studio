"""v0.6.1 — per-stack docker-compose fragment writers.

PURE ADDITIVE MODULE. Same atomic-write + external-network shape as
`airflow_overlay.py`, but with a critical contract difference:

  * Airflow / Dagster / Superset overlays are OPT-IN operational
    extras gated by `LHS_*_ENABLED` env flags. They never run by
    default.
  * Stack compose fragments here are REQUIRED to make the four
    `candidate` stacks installable at all. UDP's upstream
    docker-compose.yml does NOT ship a `nessie`, `polaris`,
    `hive-metastore`, or `postgres-hms` service definition, so each
    of those stacks would fail at the `docker compose up` step.

The runner calls `write_fragment(stack_id, install_dir, env)` from
`_step_env` after `_write_optional_overlays`. The writer returns either
a `Path` (fragment written) or `None` (no fragment needed — the stable
`udp-local-v0.2` stack hits this branch). When a path is returned, the
runner prepends an entry into `self._overlays` so the docker_compose_up
argv injects `-f docker-compose.fragment.yml` BEFORE any opt-in overlays
(so the fragment's services are visible to anything that depends on them).

Each render function returns the YAML body as a string. `write_fragment`
is responsible for writing it atomically to disk. This keeps the render
functions trivially unit-testable without touching the filesystem.

All services attach to the base stack's docker network via an `external:
true` declaration, exactly like `airflow_overlay.py`. Without this they
would land on a second network and couldn't talk to MinIO (or each other)
by service name.

    start (container exited at boot with the URN line present; a
    minimal properties file with no credentials brought it up clean).

    EXPERIMENT (this commit): drop the URN indirection AND the
    auth-type=STATIC line. Use the literal short-form keys
    `access-key-id` / `secret-access-key` -- some Nessie builds accept
    these directly and auto-detect static auth from key presence.

    FALLBACK if this still fails (try in next session):
      1. Add `nessie.catalog.service.s3.default-options.credentials-provider=STATIC`
         alongside the literal keys.
      2. Drop the keys from the properties file entirely and pass
         AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID / AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY on the nessie
         service's env block -- Nessie's S3 client (AWS SDK v2) reads
         its own process env via the default credentials provider chain.

    Credentials are interpolated from the env dict here (Python
    f-string) -- NOT compose ${VAR:-default} interpolation -- because
    this file is read by Nessie/Quarkus directly, not by docker compose.
